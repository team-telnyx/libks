 Basic UTF-8 manipulation routines
 by Jeff Bezanson
 placed in the public domain Fall 2005
 . 
 This code is designed to provide the utilities you need to manipulate
 UTF-8 as an internal string encoding. These functions do not perform the
 error checking normally needed when handling UTF-8 data, so if you happen
 to be from the Unicode Consortium you will want to flay me alive.
 I do this because error checking can be performed at the boundaries (I/O),
 with these routines reserved for higher performance on data known to be
 valid.

 The "printf" code that follows dates from the 1980's.  It is in
 the public domain.  The original comments are included here for
 completeness.  They are very out-of-date but might be useful as
 an historical reference.  Most of the "enhancements" have been backed
 out so that the functionality is now the same as standard printf().

 DISCLAIMER: As I'm giving away my work for free, I'm of course not going 
 to accept any liability of any form. This code, or the Twofish cipher, 
 might very well be flawed; you have been warned. 
 This software is provided as-is, without any kind of warrenty or

 code for free from the Internet.  
 . 
 I think it is really sad that disclaimers like this seem to be necessary. 
 If people only had a little bit more common sense, and didn't come 
 whining like little children every time something happens....
